# Install from source


> _Best option for trying latest patches(maybe experimental), forking for Pull Requests, or automatically installing all dependencies(with a few exceptions)._


## Prerequisites

When installing VidGear from source, FFmpeg and Aiortc is the only dependency you need to install manually:

!!! question "What about rest of the dependencies?"

    Any other python dependencies will be automatically installed based on your OS specifications.

### FFmpeg

Must require for the video compression and encoding compatibilities within [StreamGear](#streamgear) and [**Compression Mode**](../../gears/writegear/compression/overview/) in [WriteGear](#writegear) API. 

!!! tip "FFmpeg Installation"

    Follow this dedicated [**FFmpeg Installation doc**](../../gears/writegear/compression/advanced/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.


### Aiortc

Must Required only if you're using the [WebGear_RTC API](../../gears/webgear_rtc/overview/). You can easily install it via pip:

??? error "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required."
    
    Installing `aiortc` on windows requires Microsoft Build Tools for Visual C++ libraries installed. You can easily fix this error by installing any **ONE** of these choices:

    !!! info "While the error is calling for VC++ 14.0 - but newer versions of Visual C++ libraries works as well."

      - Microsoft [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16).
      - Alternative link to Microsoft [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019).
      - Offline installer: [vs_buildtools.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vs_buildtools.exe)

    Afterwards, Select: Workloads â†’ Desktop development with C++, then for Individual Components, select only:

      - [x] Windows 10 SDK
      - [x] C++ x64/x86 build tools

    Finally, proceed installing `aiortc` via pip.

```sh
  pip install aiortc
```

## Installation

If you want to just install and try out the checkout the latest beta [`testing`](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/tree/testing) branch , you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you have encountered is fixed in the `testing` branch. 

!!! warning "DO NOT clone or install `development` branch, as it is not tested with CI environments and is possibly very unstable or unusable."

??? tip "Windows Installation"
  
    * Install [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

    * Use following commands to clone and install VidGear:

      ```sh
        # clone the repository and get inside
        git clone https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear.git && cd vidgear

        # checkout the latest testing branch
        git checkout testing

        # install normally
        python -m pip install .

        # OR install with asyncio support
        python - m pip install .[asyncio]
      ```

```sh
  # clone the repository and get inside
  git clone https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear.git && cd vidgear

  # checkout the latest testing branch
  git checkout testing

  # install normally
  pip install .

  # OR install with asyncio support
  pip install .[asyncio]
```

**Or just install directly without cloning:**

```sh
pip install git+git://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear@testing#egg=vidgear

# or with asyncio support
pip install git+git://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear@testing#egg=vidgear[asyncio]
