# Install using pip


> _Best option for easily getting stable VidGear installed._


## Prerequisites

When installing VidGear with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), you need to check manually if following dependencies are installed:


### Core Prerequisites

* #### OpenCV 

    Must require OpenCV(3.0+) python binaries installed for all core functions. You easily install it directly via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/):

    ??? tip "OpenCV installation from source"

        You can also follow online tutorials for building & installing OpenCV on [Windows](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/), [Linux](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/), [MacOS](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) machines manually from its source. 

        :warning: Make sure not to install both *pip* and *source* version together. Otherwise installation will fail to work!

    ??? info "Other OpenCV binaries"

        OpenCV mainainers also provide additional binaries via pip that contains both main modules and contrib/extra modules [`opencv-contrib-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/), and for server (headless) environments like [`opencv-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) and [`opencv-contrib-python-headless`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python-headless/). You can also install ==any one of them== in similar manner. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python#installation-and-usage).


    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python       
    ```

### API Specific Prerequisites

* #### FFmpeg 

    Require for the video compression and encoding compatibilities within [**StreamGear**](#streamgear) API and [**WriteGear API's Compression Mode**](../../gears/writegear/compression/overview/). 

    !!! tip "FFmpeg Installation"

        Follow this dedicated [**FFmpeg Installation doc**](../../gears/writegear/compression/advanced/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

* #### Picamera

    Required only if you're using Raspberry Pi Camera Modules with its [**PiGear**](../../gears/pigear/overview/) API. You can easily install it via pip:


    !!! warning "Make sure to [**enable Raspberry Pi hardware-specific settings**](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/quickstart.html) prior to using this library, otherwise it won't work."

    ```sh
    pip install picamera
    ``` 

* #### Aiortc

    Required only if you're using the [**WebGear_RTC**](../../gears/webgear_rtc/overview/) API. You can easily install it via pip:

    ??? error "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required."
        
        Installing `aiortc` on windows requires Microsoft Build Tools for Visual C++ libraries installed. You can easily fix this error by installing any **ONE** of these choices:

        !!! info "While the error is calling for VC++ 14.0 - but newer versions of Visual C++ libraries works as well."

          - Microsoft [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16).
          - Alternative link to Microsoft [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019).
          - Offline installer: [vs_buildtools.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vs_buildtools.exe)

        Afterwards, Select: Workloads â†’ Desktop development with C++, then for Individual Components, select only:

          - [x] Windows 10 SDK
          - [x] C++ x64/x86 build tools

        Finally, proceed installing `aiortc` via pip.

    ```sh
    pip install aiortc
    ``` 

* #### Uvloop

    Required only if you're using the [**NetGear_Async**](../../gears/netgear_async/overview/) API on UNIX machines for maximum performance. You can easily install it via pip:

    !!! error "uvloop is **[NOT yet supported on Windows Machines](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop/issues/14).**"
    !!! warning "Python-3.6 legacies support [**dropped in version `>=1.15.0`**](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop/releases/tag/v0.15.0). Kindly install previous `0.14.0` version instead."

    ```sh
    pip install uvloop
    ```

## Installation

**Installation is as simple as:**

??? warning "Windows Installation"

    If you are using Windows, some of the commands given below, may not work out-of-the-box.

    A quick solution may be to preface every Python command with `python -m` like this:

    ```sh
    python -m pip install vidgear

    # or with asyncio support
    python -m pip install vidgear[asyncio]
    ```

    If you don't have the privileges to the directory you're installing package. Then use `--user` flag, that makes pip install packages in your home directory instead:

    ``` sh
    python -m pip install --user vidgear

    # or with asyncio support
    python -m pip install --user vidgear[asyncio]
    ```

```sh
# Install stable release
pip install vidgear

# Or Install stable release with Asyncio support
pip install vidgear[asyncio]
```

**And if you prefer to install VidGear directly from the repository:**

```sh
pip install git+git://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear@master#egg=vidgear

# or with asyncio support
pip install git+git://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear@master#egg=vidgear[asyncio]
```

**Or you can also download its wheel (`.whl`) package from our repository's [releases](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/releases) section, and thereby can be installed as follows:**

```sh
pip install vidgear-0.2.2-py3-none-any.whl

# or with asyncio support
pip install vidgear-0.2.2-py3-none-any.whl[asyncio]
```
