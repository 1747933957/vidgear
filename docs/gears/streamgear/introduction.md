## Overview

> StreamGear streamlines and simplifies the transcoding workflow to generate _Ultra-Low Latency, High-Quality, Dynamic & Adaptive Streaming Formats like MPEG-DASH and Apple HLS_ with just a few lines of Python code, allowing developers to focus on their application logic rather than dealing with the complexities of transcoding and chunking media files.

StreamGear API provides a standalone, highly extensible, and flexible wrapper around the [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) multimedia framework for generating chunk-encoded media segments from your multimedia content effortlessly.

With StreamGear, you can transcode source video/audio files and real-time video frames into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments of suitable lengths. These segments facilitate streaming at different quality levels _(bitrates or spatial resolutions)_ and allow for seamless switching between quality levels during playback based on available bandwidth. You can serve these segments on a web server, making them easily accessible via standard **HTTP GET** requests.

SteamGear currently supports both [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_  and [**Apple HLS**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming) _(HTTP Live Streaming)_. 

Additionally, StreamGear generates a manifest file _(such as MPD for DASH)_ or a master playlist _(such as M3U8 for Apple HLS)_ alongside the segments. These files contain essential segment information, _including timing, URLs, and media characteristics like video resolution and adaptive bitrate_. They are provided to the client before the streaming session begins.

!!! alert "For streaming with older traditional protocols such as RTMP, RTSP/RTP you could use [WriteGear](../../writegear/introduction/) API instead."

&thinsp;

??? new "New in v0.2.2" 

    Apple HLS support was added in `v0.2.2`.


!!! danger "Important"
	
	* StreamGear **MUST** requires FFmpeg executables for its core operations. Follow these dedicated [Platform specific Installation Instructions âž¶](../ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

	* :warning: StreamGear API will throw **RuntimeError**, if it fails to detect valid FFmpeg executable on your system.

	* It is advised to enable logging _([`logging=True`](../params/#logging))_ on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

!!! tip "Useful Links"

## Mode of Operations

StreamGear primarily operates in following independent modes for transcoding:


???+ alert "Real-time Frames Mode itself is NOT Live-Streaming :material-video-wireless-outline:"
    To enable live-streaming in Real-time Frames Mode, use the exclusive [`-livestream`](../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter in the StreamGear API. Checkout [this usage example âž¶](../rtfm/usage/#bare-minimum-usage-with-live-streaming) for more information.

- [**Single-Source Mode :material-file-video-outline:**](../ssm/overview) : In this mode, StreamGear **transcodes entire video file** _(as opposed to frame-by-frame)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. This mode works exceptionally well when you're transcoding long-duration lossless videos(with audio) for streaming that required no interruptions. But on the downside, the provided source cannot be flexibly manipulated or transformed before sending onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. 

- [**Real-time Frames Mode :material-camera-burst:**](../rtfm/overview) : In this mode, StreamGear directly **transcodes frame-by-frame** _(as opposed to a entire video file)_, into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. This mode works exceptionally well when you desire to flexibility manipulate or transform [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy-ndarray) frames in real-time before sending them onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. But on the downside, audio has to added manually _(as separate source)_ for streams.
