## Overview

> StreamGear automates transcoding workflow for generating _Ultra-Low Latency, High-Quality, Dynamic & Adaptive Streaming Formats (such as MPEG-DASH)_ in just few lines of python code. 

StreamGear provides a standalone, highly extensible, and flexible wrapper around [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) multimedia framework for generating chunked-encoded media segments of the content.

SteamGear easily transcodes source videos/audio files & real-time video-frames and breaks them into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments of fixed length. These segments make it possible to stream videos at different quality levels _(different bitrates or spatial resolutions)_ and can be switched in the middle of a video from one quality level to another â€“ if bandwidth permits â€“ on a per-segment basis. A user can serve these segments on a web server that makes it easier to download them through HTTP standard-compliant GET requests.

SteamGear also creates a Manifest file _(such as MPD in-case of DASH)_ besides segments that describe these segment information _(timing, URL, media characteristics like video resolution and bit rates)_ and is provided to the client before the streaming session.

SteamGear currently only supports [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_ , but other adaptive streaming technologies such as Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, will be added soon. Also, Multiple DRM support is yet to be implemented.

!!! danger "Important"
	
	* StreamGear **MUST** requires FFmpeg executables for its core operations. Follow these dedicated [Platform specific Installation Instructions âž¶](../ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

	* :warning: StreamGear API will throw **RuntimeError**, if it fails to detect valid FFmpeg executables on your system.

	* It is advised to enable logging _([`logging=True`](../params/#logging))_ on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

&thinsp; 

## Mode of Operations

StreamGear primarily operates in following independent modes for transcoding:

- [**Single-Source Mode**](../ssm/overview): In this mode, StreamGear transcodes entire video/audio file _(as opposed to frames by frame)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. This mode works exceptionally well, when you're transcoding lossless long-duration videos(with audio) for streaming and required no extra efforts or interruptions. But on the downside, the provided source cannot be changed or manipulated before sending onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. 

- [**Real-time Frames Mode**](../rtfm/overview): In this mode, StreamGear directly transcodes video-frames _(as opposed to a entire file)_, into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. In this mode, StreamGear supports real-time [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy-ndarray) frames, and process them over FFmpeg pipeline. But on the downside, audio has to added manually _(as separate source)_ for streams.

## Importing

You can import StreamGear API in your program as follows:

```python
from vidgear.gears import StreamGear
```
