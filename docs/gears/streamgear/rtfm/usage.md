# StreamGear API Usage Examples: Real-time Frames Mode :material-camera-burst:


!!! alert "Real-time Frames Mode itself is NOT Live-Streaming :material-video-wireless-outline:"

    To enable live-streaming in Real-time Frames Mode, use the exclusive [`-livestream`](../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter in the StreamGear API. Checkout following [usage example ➶](#bare-minimum-usage-with-live-streaming) for more information.

!!! warning "Important Information :fontawesome-solid-person-military-pointing:"
    
    - [x] StreamGear API **MUST** requires FFmpeg executables for its core operations. Follow these dedicated [Platform specific Installation Instructions ➶](../../ffmpeg_install/) for its installation. API will throw **RuntimeError**, if it fails to detect valid FFmpeg executables on your system.
    - [x] In this mode, ==API by default generates a primary stream _(at the index `0`)_ of same resolution as the input frames and at default framerate[^1].==
    - [x] In this mode, API **DOES NOT** automatically maps video-source audio to generated streams. You need to manually assign separate audio-source through [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter.
    - [x] In this mode, Stream copy (`-vcodec copy`) is not compatible as this mode requires re-encoding of incoming frames.
    - [x] Always use `close()` function at the very end of the main code.

???+ danger "DEPRECATION NOTICES for `v0.3.3` and above"
    
    - [ ] The `terminate()` method in StreamGear is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Developers should use the new [`close()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.close) method instead, as it offers a more descriptive name, similar to the WriteGear API, for safely terminating StreamGear processes.
    - [ ] The `rgb_mode` parameter in [`stream()`](../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) method, which earlier used to support RGB frames in Real-time Frames Mode is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. Only BGR format frames will be supported going forward. Please update your code to handle BGR format frames.

## Bare-Minimum Usage with controlled Input-framerate

> In Real-time Frames Mode, StreamGear API provides the exclusive [`-input_framerate`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute for the `stream_params` dictionary parameter, which allows you to set the assumed constant framerate for incoming frames.

In this example, we will retrieve the framerate from a webcam video stream and set it as the value for the `-input_framerate` attribute in StreamGear.

## Bare-Minimum Usage with Live-Streaming

You can easily activate **Low-latency Live-Streaming :material-video-wireless-outline:** in Real-time Frames Mode, where chunks will contain information for new frames only and forget previous ones, using the exclusive [`-livestream`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter.
The complete example is as follows:

!!! danger "In this mode, StreamGear **DOES NOT** automatically maps video-source audio to generated streams. You need to manually assign separate audio-source through [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter."

=== "DASH"

    !!! tip "Controlling chunk size in DASH"
        To control the number of frames kept in Chunks for the DASH stream _(controlling latency)_, you can use the `-window_size` and `-extra_window_size` FFmpeg parameters. Lower values for these parameters will result in lower latency.

    !!! alert "After every few chunks _(equal to the sum of `-window_size` and `-extra_window_size` values)_, all chunks will be overwritten while Live-Streaming. This means that newer chunks in the manifest will contain NO information from older chunks, and the resulting DASH stream will only play the most recent frames, reducing latency."

## Usage with Additional Streams

> Similar to Single-Source Mode, in addition to the Primary Stream, you can easily generate any number of additional Secondary Streams with variable bitrate or spatial resolution, using the exclusive [`-streams`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter.

To generate Secondary Streams, add each desired resolution and bitrate/framerate as a list of dictionaries to the `-streams` attribute. StreamGear will handle the rest automatically. The complete example is as follows:

!!! info "A more detailed information on `-streams` attribute can be found [here ➶](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters)" 

!!! alert "In this mode, StreamGear DOES NOT automatically maps video-source audio to generated streams. You need to manually assign separate audio-source through [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter."

???+ danger "Important Information about `-streams` attribute :material-file-document-alert-outline:"

    * In addition to the user-defined Secondary Streams, StreamGear automatically generates a Primary Stream _(at index `0`)_ with the same resolution as the input frames and at default framerate[^1].
    * :warning: Ensure that your system, machine, server, or network can handle the additional resource requirements of the Secondary Streams. Exercise discretion when configuring multiple streams.
    * You **MUST** define the `-resolution` value for each stream; otherwise, the stream will be discarded.
    * You only need to define either the `-video_bitrate` or the `-framerate` for a valid stream. 
        * If you specify the `-framerate`, the video bitrate will be calculated automatically.
        * If you define both the `-video_bitrate` and the `-framerate`, the `-framerate` will get discard automatically.

!!! failure "Always use the `-streams` attribute to define additional streams safely. Duplicate or incorrect definitions can break the transcoding pipeline and corrupt the output chunks."

## Usage with File Audio-Input

> In Real-time Frames Mode, if you want to add audio to your streams, you need to use the exclusive [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter.

To add a audio source, provide the path to your audio file as a string to the `-audio` attribute. The API will automatically validate and map the audio to all generated streams. The complete example is as follows:

!!! failure "Ensure the provided `-audio` audio source is compatible with the input video source. Incompatibility can cause multiple errors or result in no output at all."

!!! warning "You **MUST** use [`-input_framerate`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute to set exact value of input framerate when using external audio in Real-time Frames mode, otherwise audio delay will occur in output streams."

!!! tip "You can also assign a valid audio URL as input instead of a file path. More details can be found [here ➶](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters)"

## Usage with Device Audio-Input

> In Real-time Frames Mode, you can also use the exclusive [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of the `stream_params` dictionary parameter for streaming live audio from an external device.

To stream live audio, format your audio device name followed by a suitable demuxer as a list, and assign it to the `-audio` attribute. The API will automatically validate and map the audio to all generated streams. The complete example is as follows:

## Usage with Hardware Video-Encoder

> In Real-time Frames Mode, you can easily change the video encoder according to your requirements by passing the `-vcodec` FFmpeg parameter as an attribute in the `stream_params` dictionary parameter. Additionally, you can specify additional properties, features, and optimizations for your system's GPU.

In this example, we will be using `h264_vaapi` as our Hardware Encoder and specifying the device hardware's location and compatible video filters  by formatting them as attributes in the `stream_params` dictionary parameter.

!!! danger "This example is just conveying the idea of how to use FFmpeg's hardware encoders with the StreamGear API in Real-time Frames Mode, which MAY OR MAY NOT suit your system. Please use suitable parameters based on your supported system and FFmpeg configurations only."

!!! warning "Stream copy (`-vcodec copy`) is not compatible with this Mode as it requires re-encoding of incoming frames."

??? info "Check VAAPI support"

    To use `h264_vaapi` encoder, remember to check if its available and your FFmpeg compiled with VAAPI support. You can easily do this by executing following one-liner command in your terminal, and observing if output contains something similar as follows:

    ```sh
    ffmpeg  -hide_banner -encoders | grep vaapi 

     V..... h264_vaapi           H.264/AVC (VAAPI) (codec h264)
     V..... hevc_vaapi           H.265/HEVC (VAAPI) (codec hevc)
     V..... mjpeg_vaapi          MJPEG (VAAPI) (codec mjpeg)
     V..... mpeg2_vaapi          MPEG-2 (VAAPI) (codec mpeg2video)
     V..... vp8_vaapi            VP8 (VAAPI) (codec vp8)
    ```

!!! failure "Please read the [**FFmpeg Documentation**](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) carefully before passing any additional values to the `stream_params` parameter. Incorrect values may cause errors or result in no output."
