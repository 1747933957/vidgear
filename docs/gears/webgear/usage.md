# WebGear API Usage Examples:

## Requirements

### Installation with Asyncio Support


WebGear API is the part of `asyncio` package of VidGear, thereby you need to install VidGear with asyncio support as follows:

  ```sh
  pip install vidgear[asyncio]
  ```


### ASGI Server

You'll also need to install an ASGI Server to run following WebGear usage examples, and by default WebGear ships the state-of-the-art [**`uvicorn`**](http://www.uvicorn.org/) Server. But you can also use other ASGI server such as [`daphne`](https://github.com/django/daphne/), or [`hypercorn`](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/) with it.


&nbsp; 


## Bare-Minimum Usage

Following is the bare-minimum code you need to get started with WebGear API:

!!! warning "If you experience any performance-throttling/lag while running this bare-minimum example, then Kindly see advanced [Performance Tweaks âž¶](/gears/webgear/advanced/#performance-enhancements)."

### Running Programmatically

You can access and run WebGear VideoStreamer Server programmatically in your python script in just a few lines of code, as follows:

```python
# import libs
import uvicorn
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import WebGear

# initialize WebGear app  
web=WebGear(source="test.mp4")

# run this app on Uvicorn server
uvicorn.run(web(), host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)

# close app safely
web.shutdown()
```
That's all. Now, just run that, and a live video stream can be accessed on any browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ address.


### Running from Terminal

You can access and run WebGear Server directly from the terminal commandline as follows:

!!! danger "Make sure your `PYTHON_PATH` is set to python 3.6+ versions only."

The following command will run a WebGear VideoStreamer server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/:

```sh
python3 -m vidgear.gears.asyncio --source test.avi 

```
which can be accessed on any browser on the network.

??? tip "Advanced Usage from Terminal"

    You can run `#!py3 python3 -m vidgear.gears -h` help command to see all the advanced settings, as follows:

    !!! warning "If you're using `--options/-op` flag, then kindly wrap your dictionary value in single `''` quotes as shown in [this example](/gears/webgear/advanced/#running-from-terminal)."

    ```sh
    usage: python -m vidgear.gears.asyncio [-h] [-s SOURCE] [-ep ENABLEPICAMERA] [-S STABILIZE]
            [-cn CAMERA_NUM] [-yt Y_TUBE] [-b BACKEND] [-cs COLORSPACE]
            [-r RESOLUTION] [-f FRAMERATE] [-td TIME_DELAY]
            [-ip IPADDRESS] [-pt PORT] [-l LOGGING] [-op OPTIONS]

    Runs WebGear VideoStreaming Server through terminal.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                            Path to input source for CamGear API.
      -ep ENABLEPICAMERA, --enablePiCamera ENABLEPICAMERA
                            Sets the flag to access PiGear(if True) or otherwise
                            CamGear API respectively.
      -S STABILIZE, --stabilize STABILIZE
                            Enables/disables real-time video stabilization.
      -cn CAMERA_NUM, --camera_num CAMERA_NUM
                            Sets the camera module index that will be used by
                            PiGear API.
      -yt Y_TUBE, --y_tube Y_TUBE
                            Enables YouTube Mode in CamGear API.
      -b BACKEND, --backend BACKEND
                            Sets the backend of the video source in CamGear API.
      -cs COLORSPACE, --colorspace COLORSPACE
                            Sets the colorspace of the output video stream.
      -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                            Sets the resolution (width,height) for camera module
                            in PiGear API.
      -f FRAMERATE, --framerate FRAMERATE
                            Sets the framerate for camera module in PiGear API.
      -td TIME_DELAY, --time_delay TIME_DELAY  
                            Sets the time delay(in seconds) before start reading
                            the frames.
      -ip IPADDRESS, --ipaddress IPADDRESS
                            Uvicorn binds the socket to this ipaddress.
      -pt PORT, --port PORT
                            Uvicorn binds the socket to this port.
      -l LOGGING, --logging LOGGING
                            Enables/disables error logging, essential for
