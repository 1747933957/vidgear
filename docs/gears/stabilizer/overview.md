!!! info "This video is transcoded with [**StreamGear API**](../../streamgear/overview/) and hosted on [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear-docs-additionals) and served with [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com)"



## Overview

> Stabilizer is an auxiliary class that enables Video Stabilization for vidgear with minimalistic latency, and at the expense of little to no additional computational requirements. 

The basic idea behind it is to tracks and save the salient feature array for the given number of frames and then uses these anchor point to cancel out all perturbations relative to it for the incoming frames in the queue. This class relies heavily on [**Threaded Queue mode**](../../../bonus/TQM/) for error-free & ultra-fast frame handling.

&thinsp; 

## Features

- [x] _Real-time stabilization with low latency and no extra resources._

- [x] _Works exceptionally well with low-frequency jitter._

- [x] _Integrated with [VideoGear](../usage/#using-videogear-with-stabilizer-backend), therefore, can be applied to any incoming stream._

- [x] _Also seamlessly works standalone._


&thinsp;


!!! danger "Important" 

	- The stabilizer may not perform well against High-frequency jitter in video. Use at your own risk!

	- :warning: The stabilizer might be slower for High-Quality videos-frames.

	- It is advised to enable logging on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.
