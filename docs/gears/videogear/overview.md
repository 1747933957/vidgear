## Overview

> VideoGear API provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive [**Video Stabilizer**](../../stabilizer/overview/) class. 

VideoGear also acts as a Common Video-Capture API that provides internal access for both [CamGear](../../camgear/overview/) and [PiGear](../../pigear/overview/) APIs and their parameters with an exclusive [`enablePiCamera`](../params/#enablepicamera) boolean flag.

VideoGear is ideal when you need to switch to different video sources without changing your code much. Also, it enables easy stabilization for various video-streams _(real-time or not)_  with minimum effort and writing way fewer lines of code.

!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

	* If you're already familar with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library, then see [Switching from OpenCV âž¶](../../switch_from_cv/#switching-videocapture-apis)

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.


!!! warning "Make sure to [enable Raspberry Pi hardware-specific settings](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/quickstart.html) prior using PiGear API, otherwise nothing will work."
