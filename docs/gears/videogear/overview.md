## Overview

> VideoGear provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive [**Video Stabilizer**](../../stabilizer/overview/) class. 

VideoGear also act as a Common API, that provides an internal access to both [CamGear](../../camgear/overview/) and [PiGear](../../pigear/overview/) APIs and their parameters, with a special [`enablePiCamera`](../params/#enablepicamera) boolean flag.

VideoGear is basically ideal when you need to switch to different video sources without changing your code much. Also, it enables easy stabilization for various video-streams _(real-time or not)_  with minimum effort and using way fewer lines of code.

!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

	* If you're already familar with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library, then see [Switching from OpenCV âž¶](../../switch_from_cv/#switching-videocapture-apis)

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

	* You can use `framerate` class variable to retrieve framerate of the input source.
