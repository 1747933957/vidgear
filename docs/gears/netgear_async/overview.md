## Overview

> NetGear_Async is an asyncio videoframe messaging framework, built on [`zmq.asyncio`](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/zmq.asyncio.html), and powered by high-performance asyncio event loop called [**`uvloop`**](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) to achieve unmatchable high-speed and lag-free video streaming over the network with minimal resource constraints. Basically, this API is able to transfer thousands of frames in just a few seconds without causing any significant load on your system. 

NetGear_Async can generate double performance as compared to [NetGear API](../../netgear/overview/) at about 1/3rd of memory consumption, and also provide complete server-client handling with various options to use variable protocols/patterns similar to NetGear, but it doesn't support any [NetGear's Exclusive Modes](../../netgear/overview/#exclusive-modes) yet. 

Furthermore, NetGear_Async allows us to  define our own custom Server Source to manipulate frames easily before sending them across the network(see this [usage example](../usage/#using-netgear_async-with-a-custom-sourceopencv)). In addition to all this, NetGear_Async also **provides a special internal wrapper around [VideoGear API](../../videogear/overview/)**, which itself provides internal access to both [CamGear](../../camgear/overview/) and [PiGear](../../pigear/overview/) APIs thereby granting it exclusive power for streaming frames incoming from any connected device/source to the network.

NetGear_Async as of now supports four ZeroMQ messaging patterns:

- [x] [`zmq.PAIR`](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/pair.html) _(ZMQ Pair Pattern)_
- [x] [`zmq.REQ/zmq.REP`](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/client_server.html) _(ZMQ Request/Reply Pattern)_
- [x] [`zmq.PUB/zmq.SUB`](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/pubsub.html) _(ZMQ Publish/Subscribe Pattern)_ 
- [x] [`zmq.PUSH/zmq.PULL`](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/pushpull.html#push-pull) _(ZMQ Push/Pull Pattern)_

Whereas supported protocol are: `tcp` and `ipc`.

!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

	* It is advised to comprehend [NetGear API](../../netgear/overview/) before using this API.
