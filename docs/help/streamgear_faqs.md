# StreamGear FAQs

&thinsp;

## What is StreamGear API and what does it do?

**Answer:** StreamGear automates transcoding workflow for generating _Ultra-Low Latency, High-Quality, Dynamic & Adaptive Streaming Formats (such as MPEG-DASH)_ in just few lines of python code. _For more info. see [StreamGear doc ➶](../../gears/streamgear/introduction/)_

&thinsp;

## How to get started with StreamGear API?

**Answer:** First, refer to the [Switching from OpenCV](../../switch_from_cv/#switching-videocapture-apis) guide, then go through [StreamGear documentation](../../gears/streamgear/overview/). If you still have doubts, ask us on [Gitter ➶](https://gitter.im/vidgear/community) Community channel.

&thinsp;

## What is `.mpd` file created with StreamGear?

**Answer:** SteamGear also creates a Manifest file _(such as MPD in-case of DASH)_ besides segments that describe these segment information _(timing, URL, media characteristics like video resolution and bit rates)_ and is provided to the client before the streaming session.

&thinsp;

## How to play Streaming Assets created with StreamGear API?

**Answer:** You can easily feed Manifest file(`.mpd`) to DASH Supported Players Input but sure encoded chunks are present along with it. See this list of [recommended players ➶](../../gears/streamgear/introduction/#recommended-stream-players)

&thinsp;

## What Adaptive Streaming Formats are supported yet?

**Answer:** SteamGear currently only supports [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_ , but other adaptive streaming technologies such as Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, will be added soon.

&thinsp;

## Is DRM Encryption supported in StreamGear API?

**Answer:** No, DRM Encryption is **NOT** supported yet.

&thinsp;

## How to create additional streams in StreamGear API?

**Answer:** [See this example ➶](../../gears/streamgear/ssm/usage/#usage-with-additional-streams)

&thinsp;


## How to use StreamGear API with OpenCV?

**Answer:** [See this example ➶](../../gears/streamgear/rtfm/usage/#bare-minimum-usage-with-opencv)

&thinsp;

## How to use StreamGear API with real-time frames?

**Answer:** See [Real-time Frames Mode ➶](../../gears/streamgear/rtfm/overview)

&thinsp;

## How to use StreamGear API with RGB Frames?

**Answer:** The `rgb_mode` parameter in [`stream()`](../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) method, which earlier used to support RGB frames in Real-time Frames Mode is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. Only BGR format frames will be supported going forward. Please update your code to handle BGR format frames.

## How to use Hardware/GPU encoder for StreamGear trancoding?

**Answer:** [See this example ➶](../../gears/streamgear/rtfm/usage/#usage-with-hardware-video-encoder)
