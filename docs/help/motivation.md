# Project Motivation


## Why is VidGear a thing?

The original motivation and thinking behind creating this project was to build an ultrafast extensible and bugfree python Video Processing library with experimental features like real-time Video-Stabilization, lossless Video-Encoding, flexible parameters manipulation, and Multi-Threading, etc. But also keeping it simple at the same time, thereby it must let programmers and software developers to easily integrate and perform complex Video Processing tasks in their existing or new applications, without going through various underlying python library's documentation and by using just a few lines of code.


## Chronicle origins

This project began as a part of [my Pull Request(PR)](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils/pull/105) to another computer vision python library -`imutils`'s video modules. In this PR I purposed countless bug fixes for the existing implementation by its author. But soon I find out that the author wasn't much interested in merging these fixes and it became apparent it did not belong to the `imutils` library itself. Therefore, I thought it may benefit others more as a separate project and that allow a wider range of experimental features and targets all available devices and video streams. _And that's the chronicle origin of VidGear_.
