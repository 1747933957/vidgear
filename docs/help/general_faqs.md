# General FAQs


&nbsp;


## "I'm new to Python Programming or its usage in Computer Vision", How to use vidgear in my projects?

**Answer:** It's recommended to first go through the following dedicated tutorials/websites thoroughly, and learn how OpenCV-Python works _(with examples)_:

- [**PyImageSearch.com** ➶](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) is the best resource for learning OpenCV and its Python implementation. Adrian Rosebrock provides many practical OpenCV techniques with tutorials, code examples, blogs, and books at PyImageSearch.com. I also learned a lot about computer vision methods and various useful techniques. Highly recommended!

- [**learnopencv.com** ➶](https://www.learnopencv.com)  Maintained by OpenCV CEO Satya Mallick. This blog is for programmers, hackers, engineers, scientists, students, and self-starters interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

- There's also the official [**OpenCV Tutorials** ➶](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html), provided by the OpenCV folks themselves.

Finally, once done, see [Switching from OpenCV ➶](../../switch_from_cv/) and go through our [Gears ➶](../../gears/#gears-what-are-these) to learn how VidGear works. If you run into any trouble or have any questions, then see [getting help ➶](../get_help)
