# Threaded Queue Mode

> Threaded Queue Mode is designed exclusively for VidGear's Videocapture Gears _(namely CamGear, ScreenGear, VideoGear)_ and few Network Gears _(such as NetGear(Client's end))_ for achieving high-performance, synchronized, and error-free video-frames handling with their **Internal Multi-Threaded Frame Extractor Daemons**. 

!!! info "Threaded-Queue-Mode is enabled by default, but a user [can disable it](#manually-disabling-threaded-queue-mode), if extremely necessary."

## What does Threaded-Queue-Mode exactly do?


Threaded-Queue-Mode helps VidGear do the Threaded Video-Processing tasks in a well-organized, and most competent way possible: 

### A. Enables Multi-Threading

In case you don't already know, OpenCV's' [`read()`](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#a473055e77dd7faa4d26d686226b292c1) is a [blocking method](https://luminousmen.com/post/asynchronous-programming-blocking-and-non-blocking) for reading/decoding the next video-frame and consumes much of the I/O bound memory depending upon our Source-properties & System-hardware. This means, it blocks the function from returning until the next frame. As a result, this behavior halts our python script's main thread completely for that moment.

Threaded-Queue-Mode employs [**Multi-Threading**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) to separate frame-decoding like tasks to multiple independent threads in layman's word. Multiple-Threads helps it execute different Video Processing I/O-bound operations all at the same time by overlapping the waiting times. In this way, Threaded-Queue-Mode keeps on processing frames faster in the [background(daemon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) without waiting for blocked I/O operations and doesn't get affected by how sluggish our main python thread is.

### B. Monitors Fix-Sized Deques

> Although Multi-threading is fast & easy, it may lead to undesired effects like _frame-skipping, deadlocks, and race conditions, etc._

Threaded-Queue-Mode utilizes **Monitored, Thread-Safe, Memory-Efficient, and Fixed-Sized [`Deques`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.deque)** _(with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction)_, that always maintains a fixed-length of frames buffer in the memory. It blocks the thread if the queue is full or otherwise pops out the frames synchronously and efficiently without any obstructions. Its fixed-length Deques stops multiple threads from accessing the same source simultaneously and thus preventing Global Interpreter Lock _(a.k.a GIL)_.

## What are the advantages of Threaded-Queue-Mode?

- [x] _Enables Blocking, Sequential and Threaded LIFO Frame Handling._

- [x] _Sequentially adds and releases frames to/from `deque` and handles the overflow of this queue._

- [x] _Utilizes thread-safe, memory efficient `deques` that appends and pops frames with same O(1) performance from either side._

- [x] _Requires less RAM at due to buffered frames in the `deque`._

## Manually disabling Threaded-Queue-Mode

To manually disable Threaded-Queue-Mode, VidGear provides `THREADED_QUEUE_MODE` boolean attribute for `options` dictionary parameter in respective [VideoCapture APIs](../../gears/#a-videocapture-gears):  

!!! warning "Important Warning"

	* This **`THREADED_QUEUE_MODE`** attribute does **NOT** work with Live feed, such as Camera Devices/Modules.

	* This **`THREADED_QUEUE_MODE`** attribute is **NOT** supported by ScreenGear & NetGear APIs, as Threaded Queue Mode is essential for their core operations.

	* Disabling Threaded-Queue-Mode will **NOT** disable Multi-Threading.

	* Disabling Threaded-Queue-Mode may lead to **Random Intermittent Bugs** that can be quite difficult to discover. *More insight can be found [here âž¶](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/issues/20#issue-452339596)*


**`THREADED_QUEUE_MODE`** _(boolean)_: This attribute can be used to override Threaded-Queue-Mode mode to manually disable it:

```python
options = {'THREADED_QUEUE_MODE': False} # to disable Threaded Queue Mode. 
```

and you can pass it to `options` dictionary parameter of the respective API.
