# Release Notes

## v0.1.9-dev (in Progress)

### New Features

- **StreamGear API:**

    * [X] New API that automates transcoding workflow for generating Ultra-Low Latency, High-Quality, Dynamic & Adaptive Streaming Formats.
    * [X] Implemented multi-platform , standalone, highly extensible and flexible wrapper around FFmpeg for generating chunked-encoded media segments of the media, and easily accessing almost all of its parameters.
    * [X] API automatically transcodes videos/audio files & real-time frames into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments and also creates a Manifest file.
    * [X] Added initial support for [MPEG-DASH](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_.
    * [X] Constructed default behavior in StreamGear, for auto-creating a Primary Stream of same resolution and framerate as source.
    * [X] Added [TQDM](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) progress bar in non-debugged output for visual representation of internal processes.
    * [X] Implemented several internal methods for preprocessing FFmpeg and internal parameters for producing streams.
    * [X] Several standalone internal checks to ensure robust performance.
    * [X] New [`terminate()`](../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.terminate) function to terminate StremGear Safely.

    * [X] New StreamGear Dual Modes of Operation:
        + Implemented *Single-Source* and *Real-time Frames* like independent Transcoding Modes.
        + Linked `-video_source` attribute for activating these modes
        + **Single-Source Mode**, transcodes entire video/audio file _(as opposed to frames by frame)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller segments for streaming
        + **Real-time Frames Mode**, directly transcodes video-frames _(as opposed to a entire file)_, into a sequence of multiple smaller segments for streaming
        + Added separate functions, [`stream()`](../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) for Real-time Frame Mode and [`transcode_source()`](../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.transcode_source) for Single-Source Mode for easy transcoding.
        + Included auto-colorspace detection and RGB Mode like features _(extracted from WriteGear)_, into StreamGear.  

    * [X] New StreamGear Parameters:
        + Developed several new parameters such as:
            + `output`: handles assets directory
            + `formats`: handles adaptive HTTP streaming format.
            + `custom_ffmpeg`: handles custom FFmpeg location.
            + `stream_params`: handles internal and FFmpeg parameter seamlessly.
            + `logging`: turns logging on or off.
        + New `stream_params` parameter allows us to exploit almost all FFmpeg parameters and flexibly change its internal settings, and seamlessly generating high-quality streams with its attributes:
            + `-streams` _(list of dictionaries)_ for building additional streams with `-resolution`, `-video_bitrate` & `-framerate` like sub-attributes.

            + `-video_source` for specifying Single-Source Mode source.
            + `-input_framerate` for handling input framerate in Real-time Frames Mode.
            + `-bpp` attribute for handling bits-per-pixels used to auto-calculate video-bitrate.
            + `-gop` to manually specify GOP length.
            + `-ffmpeg_download_path` to handle custom FFmpeg download path on windows.
            + `-clear_prev_assets` to remove any previous copies of SteamGear Assets.
